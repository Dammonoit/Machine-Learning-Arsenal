    "* Statistics is a collection of tools that you can use to get answers to important questions about data.\n",
    "* Statistics is generally considered a prerequisite to the field of applied machine learning.\n",
    "* We need statistics to help transform observations into information and to answer questions about samples of observations.\n",
    "* It's the only science where two experts using the exact same data with a proposed hypothesis may come to completely opposite conclusions.\n",

    "* All you cricket junkies out there! At the beginning of any cricket match, how do you decide who is going to bat or ball? A toss! It all depends on whether you win or lose the toss, right? Let’s say if the toss results in a head, you win. Else, you lose. There’s no midway.\n",

    "* A Bernoulli distribution has only two possible outcomes, namely 1 (success) and 0 (failure), and a single trial. So the random variable X which has a Bernoulli distribution can take value 1 with the probability of success, say p, and the value 0 with the probability of failure, say q or 1-p.\n",
